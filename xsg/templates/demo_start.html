      <td class=about_b>The X-Supply Game (XSG) is an educational game designed to help participants explore the dynamics of real supply chains.
        This demo is a single-player version of the game, where you will manage a virtual station in a simple supply chain.
        The game is played in turns, in which you'll analyze the weekly standing of your station and decide on orders to
        suppliers and shipments to customers. Your goal is to reduce costs, improve customer satisfaction, and minimize transportation
        environmental impact.

        This demo supply chain network consists of 5 stations and 2 demand points, as illustrated bellow. You will assume the role
        of the wholesaler manager, and will be responsible for ordering supplies from the manufacturers in order to meet
        the demands of the retailers, and ultimately the clients. The remaining stations are automated. Each game turn is
        a week in a 45 weeks simulation. You will have 3 minutes to complete each turn.
